Efficacies of the formulation are determined via qualitative and quantitative techniques for odour measurement. Anotec 0307 formulations can be fogged, hand sprayed, misted or drip-fed depending on the application required. Anotec 0307 is fully miscible in water with scientifically chosen and blended surfactants. This blend, when applied via either a misting, fogging device or trigger sprayer bottle, alters the surface tension of the liquid/vapor compound. A key property of the Anotec 0307 formulation is that it modifies the surface properties of chemical odour components. The primary action takes place at the chemical odour and Anotec 0307 interface. </p>,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/416a8cfbd172619d993e7a80f54aeb3ec542743d.png" title="Anotec PRO5L ">,<p>A highly concentrated water soluble liquid phase odour control formulation.
