Efficacies of the formulation are determined via qualitative and quantitative techniques for odour measurement. Anotec 0307 formulations can be fogged, hand sprayed, misted or drip-fed depending on the application required. Anotec 0307 is fully miscible in water with scientifically chosen and blended surfactants. This blend, when applied via either a misting, fogging device or trigger sprayer bottle, alters the surface tension of the liquid/vapor compound. A key property of the Anotec 0307 formulation is that it modifies the surface properties of chemical odour components. The primary action takes place at the chemical odour and Anotec 0307 interface.</p>,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/416a8cfbd172619d993e7a80f54aeb3ec542743d.png" title="Anotec PRO5L ">,<p>A highly concentrated water soluble liquid phase odour control formulation. Anotec <strong>PRO5L</strong> is intended for use as a liquid additive to malodorous (smelly) solutions and acts as an odour profiling agent. Odours inherent in any base product are significantly reduced and/or eliminated without affecting the efficacy or chemistry of the clientâ€™s product. Gone are the days when Pest Control meant asking your clients to stay away from their house for hours if not days to avoid the smell!</p>,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/874085f32b2e2d1a74fbaa2d98ed0de60a400f4a.png" title="Anotec Drum Mounted Fogmaster ">,<p>The Anotec Fogmaster DM7421 drum mounted unit features precision control of particle size, from a dry, 7-micron ULV (ultra low volume) droplet to the larger particles of conventional fogging and misting equipment. ULV application provides greater penetration and diffusion of fog particles, allowing more concentrated solutions to be used and shortening application times.</p>,<p>Also, the higher surface to volume ratio of small droplets makes them superior for odour control and other gas contact applications.

Simply bolt or hang the NEMA 4 enclosure to a wall or ceiling, plug into a power outlet and attach a low pressure liquid feed line. The fogger is ready to operate.</li><li>Intake air is drawn from user-supplied ducting leading to clean air. No fan is necessary, but ducting must be properly sized for air flows (consult factory if in doubt). Also, if unit will be operated in freezing environments, we suggest that intake ducting be routed to temper the intake air somewhat.</li><li>The power head activates when it detects liquid feed; no control wiring is needed. When your needs change, relocate heads or add more. Just connect the liquid supply line and the connection to input air.</li><li>There are lots of ways you can set up the liquid feed/control system - pump from a barrel, mix in-line with a proportional injector or feed house water supplied through a solenoid valve ... and control everything with a timer, gas monitor or even a weather station.</li><li>For more information on setting up a Sentinel II system, please see our Technical Design Notes page or contact the factory. The accessories page also lists some of the liquid transfer and timing components that can be used with Sentinel II power heads.</li></ul>]]></description>
