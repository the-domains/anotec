A highly concentrated water soluble liquid phase odour control formulation. Anotec PRO5L is intended for use as a liquid additive to malodorous (smelly) solutions and acts as an odour profiling agent. Odours inherent in any base product are significantly reduced and/or eliminated without affecting the efficacy or chemistry of the client's product.
