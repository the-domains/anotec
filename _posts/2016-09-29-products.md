  Anotec 0307 is the standard odour control, formulation. Efficacies of the
  formulation are determined via qualitative and quantitative techniques for
  odour measurement. Anotec 0307 formulations can be fogged, hand sprayed,
  misted or drip-fed depending on the application required. Anotec 0307 is fully
  miscible in water with scientifically chosen and blended surfactants. This
  blend, when applied via either a misting, fogging device or trigger sprayer
  bottle, alters the surface tension of the liquid/vapor compound. A key
  property of the Anotec 0307 formulation is that it modifies the surface
  properties of chemical odour components. The primary action takes place at the
  chemical odour and Anotec 0307 interface.

A highly concentrated water soluble liquid phase odour control formulation. Anotec **PRO5L** is intended for use as a liquid additive to malodorous (smelly) solutions and acts as an odour profiling agent. Odours inherent in any base product are significantly reduced and/or eliminated without affecting the efficacy or chemistry of the client's product. Gone are the days when Pest Control meant asking your clients to stay away from their house for hours if not days to avoid the smell!

The Anotec Fogmaster DM7421 drum mounted unit features precision control of particle size, from a dry, 7-micron ULV (ultra low volume) droplet to the larger particles of conventional fogging and misting equipment. ULV application provides greater penetration and diffusion of fog particles, allowing more concentrated solutions to be used and shortening application times.

Also, the higher surface to volume ratio of small droplets makes them superior for odour control and other gas contact applications.
